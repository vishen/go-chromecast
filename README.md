# Chromecast

Implements a basic number of the google chromecast commands. Other than the basic commands, it also allows you to play media files from your computer either individually or in a playlist; the `playlist` command will look at all the files in a folder and play them sorted by numerically.

## Media Content Playable

Can play / load a local media file or a file hosted on the internet on your chromecast.

```
Supported Media formats:
    - MP3
    - AVI
    - MKV
    - MP4
    - WebM
    - FLAC
    - WAV
```

If an unknown file is found, it will use `ffmpeg` to transcode it to MP4, and stream it to the chromecast.

## Play Local Media Files

We are able to play local media files by creating a http server that will stream the media file to the cast device.

## Cast DNS Lookup

A DNS multicast is used to determine the Chromecast and Google Home devices.

The cast DNS entry is also cached, this means that if you pass through the device name, `-n <name>`, or the
device uuid, `-u <uuid>`, the results will be cached and it will connect to the chromecast device instanly.

## User Interface

![User-interface example](go-chromecast-ui.png "User-interface example")

A basic terminal user-interface is provided, that supports the following controls:
* Quit: "q"
* Play/Pause: SPACE
* Volume: - / +
* Mute/Unmute: "m"
* Seek (15s): <- / ->
* Previous/Next: PgUp / PgDn
* Stop: "s"

It can be run in the following ways:

### Standalone

If you just want to remote-control a chromecast that is already playing something:

```
$ go-chromecast ui
```

### Playlist

Use the UI in combination with the `playlist` command (detailed above):

```
$ go-chromecast --with-ui playlist /path/to/directory
```

### Load

Use the UI in combination with the `load` command (detailed above):

```
$ go-chromecast --with-ui load /path/to/file.flac
```

## Playlist

There is support for playing media items as a playlist.

If playing from a playlist, you are able to pass though the `--select` flag, and this will allow you to select
the media to start playing from. This is useful if you have already played some of the media and want to start
from one you haven't played yet.

A cache is kept of played media, so if you are playing media from a playlist, it will check to see what
media files you have recently played and play the next one from the playlist. `--continue=false` can be passed
through and this will start the playlist from the start.

## Discover sent and received events from a Device

If you would like to see what a device is sending, you are able to `watch` the protobuf messages being sent from your device:

```
$ go-chromecast watch
```

### Text To Speech

Experimental text-to-speech support has been added. This uses [Google
Cloud's Text-to-Speech](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/) to
turn text into an mp3 audio file, this is then streamed to the device.

Text-to-speech api needs to be enabled https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=texttospeech.googleapis.com and a google service account is required https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/serviceaccountkey

```
$ go-chromecast tts <message_to_say> --google-service-account=/path/to/service/account.json
```

For non en-US languages

```
$ go-chromecast tts <message_to_say> --google-service-account=/path/to/service/account.json \
  --language-code ja-JP
```
